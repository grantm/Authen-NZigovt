=head1 NAME

Authen::NZigovt - Tools for integrating with the New Zealand igovt logon service (now "RealMe")

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<STATUS: DEPRECATED> - this module has been renamed to L<Authen::NZRealMe> and
all further development is taking place there.  This module will be removed
from CPAN shortly.

This module provides an API for integrating your application with the New
Zealand igovt logon service using SAML 2.0 messaging.

I<Note>: Since the "igovt logon service" was rebranded to "RealMe" in 2013, this
module is now misnamed, however it does continue to work with the new RealMe
service.  The code may be re-released under a new name in the future.

The distribution also includes a command-line tool called C<nzigovt> which can
be used for:

=over 4

=item *

generating certificate/key pairs for signing and SSL encryption

=item *

creating/editing the Service Provider metadata file

=item *

creating a bundle (zip file) containing metadata and certs for upload to the
IdP

=item *

generating AuthnRequest URLs

=item *

decoding/dumping AuthnRequest URLs

=item *

resolving SAMLart artifact responses and validating the response

=back

Run C<< nzigovt --help >> for more information about using the command-line tool.

=head1 GETTING STARTED

You cannot simply drop some config files in a directory and start
authenticating users.  Your agency will need to establish a Service Provider
role with the logon service and complete the required integration steps.  Your
first step should be to make contact with the igovt logon service and arrange a
meeting.


=head1 CODE INTEGRATION

To integrate the igovt logon service with your application, you will need to:

=over 4

=item 1

complete a number of configuration steps (see L</CONFIGURATION> below)

=item 2

link this module into your application to initiate the logon (by redirecting
the user to the igovt logon service) and to 'consume' the login information
when the user is redirected back to your site

=back

To understand how this module must be linked into your application, it helps to
understand the SAML protocol interaction that is followed for each user logon:

  Agency Web Site                                 igovt logon server

 .-------------------------.

 '-------------------------'
  API call returns

The igovt logon server is a SAML Identity Provider or 'IdP'.

The agency web site is a SAML Service Provider or 'SP'.  The Authen::NZigovt
module implements the SAML SP role on behalf of the agency web app.

To integrate this module with your application, you need to make two calls to
its API: the first to generate the authentication request (step 2 above) and
the second to resolve the returned artifact and return the Federated Logon Tag
(FLT) which identifies the user (steps 6 thru 8).

It is your responsibility to create a persistent association in your
application data store between your user record and the igovt FLT for that
user.

=head2 Authentication Request

You will add the igovt logon button image to your application templates.  The
button does not link directly to the igovt logon server, but instead links to
your application which in turn uses the Authen::NZigovt module to generate a
SAML AuthnRequest message encoded in a URL and returns it as a 302 redirect.

The request includes a unique 'Request ID' which you must save in the user
session for use when resolving the artifact response later.  The example below
uses generic framework method calls to save the Request ID and return the
redirect URL, you will need to replace these with specific calls for the
framework you are using:

  use Authen::NZigovt;

  my $sp  = Authen::NZigovt->service_provider( conf_dir => $path_to_config_directory );
  my $req = $sp->new_request(
      allow_create => 0,         # set to 1 for initial registration
      # other options here
  );

  $framework->set_state(igovt_request_id => $req->request_id);

  return $framework->redirect($req->as_url);  # Use HTTP status 302

Your code does not need to explicitly reference the igovt logon service domain
or URL - these details are handled automatically by the configuration.

=head2 Artifact Resolution

Once the user has provided a valid username and password to the logon service,
they will be redirected back to your application and an 'artifact' will be
passed in a URL parameter called 'SAMLart'.  You set up which URL you want the
logon service to redirect back to when you generate your service provider
metadata (see L</CONFIGURATION>).  This URL is known as the Assertion Consumer
Service or 'ACS'.

A single method call is used to:

=over 4

=item *

generate a SAML ArtifactResolve message

=item *

pass it to the IdP over a backchannel

=item *

accept the SAML ArtifactResponse message

=item *

validate the assertion

=item *

extract and return the FLT (or error detail) in a response object

=back

The method call will return a response object containing either an FLT or
details of the condition which meant the logon was unsuccessful.  In the case
of an unexpected error, the method call will generate an exception which you
will need to catch and log.

  my $sp   = Authen::NZigovt->service_provider( conf_dir => $path_to_config_directory );
  my $resp = eval {
      $sp->resolve_artifact(
          artifact   => $framework->param('SAMLart'),
          request_id => $framework->get_state('igovt_request_id'),
      );
  };
  if($@) {
      # handle catastrophic failures (e.g.: malformed response) here
  }
  if($resp->is_success) {
      $framework->set_state(igovt_flt => $resp->flt);
      # ... redirect to main menu etc
  }
  elsif($resp->is_timeout) {
      # Present logon screen again with message
  }
  elsif($resp->is_cancel) {
      # Present logon screen again with message
  }
  elsif($resp->is_not_registered) {
      # Only happens if allow_create set to false
      # and user does not have a logon for our site
  }
  else {
      # Some other failure occurred, user might like to try again later.
      # Should present $resp->status_message to user and also give contact
      # details for igovt Help Desk
  }

Note: there are two different categories of 'error': the C<resolve_artifact()>
method might throw an exception (caught by eval, details in $@); or a response
object might be returned but with C<< $resp->is_success >> set to false.  The
details of an exception should be logged, but not displayed back to the user.
In the event that your application displays the contents of
C<< $resp->status_message >> you should ensure that you apply appropriate HTML
escaping.

L<Authen::NZigovt::ServiceProvider>.


=head1 CONFIGURATION

This module is configuration-driven - when making an API call, you specify the
path to the config directory and the module picks up everything it needs to
talk to the NZ igovt logon service Identity Provider from metadata files and
certificate/key-pair files used for signing/encryption.

=head2 Config Files Overview

The files in the config directory use the following naming convention so you
just need to point the module at the right directory.  The filenames are:

=over 4

=item C<metadata-sp.xml>

This file contains config parameters for the 'Service Provider' - your end of
the authentication dialog.  Once you have generated the SP metadata file (see:
L</Generating Config Files>) you will need to provide it to the NZ igovt logon
service to install at their end.  You will need to generate separate metadata
files for each of your development, staging and production environments.

=item C<metadata-idp.xml>

The IdP or Identity Provider metadata file will be provided to you by the NZ
igovt logon service.  You will simply need to copy it to the config directory
and give it the correct name.

=item C<sp-sign-crt.pem>

This certificate file is used for generating digital signatures for the SP
metadata file and SAML authentication requests.  For your initial integration
with the igovt logon service development IdP ('MTS'), certificate key-pair
files will be provided to you.  For staging (ITE) and production, you will need
to generate your own and provide the certificate files (not the private key
files) to the igovt logon service.

=item C<sp-sign-key.pem>

This private key is paired with the F<sp-sign-crt.pem> certificate.

=item C<sp-ssl-crt.pem>

This certificate is used for negotiating an SSL connection on the backchannel
to the IdP artifact resolution service.

=item C<sp-ssl-key.pem>

This private key is paired with the F<sp-ssl-crt.pem> certificate.

=back

=head2 Generating Config Files

You must first decide which directory your config files will be stored in.
The examples below assume a config directory path of C</etc/nzigovt>.

=head3 Certificates

Once you've decided on a location, you need to generate two SSL certificates
and their corresponding private keys.  The first will be used for signing the
SAML AuthnRequest messages and the second will be used for mutual SSL
encryption of communications over the back-channel.

It is not necessary to generate the certificates on the same machine where
they will be used however you must have the C<openssl> command-line tools
installed on the machine where you wish to generate them.

The process for generating certificates will depend on which environment you
are connecting to:

=over 4

=item MTS (Development)

You do not need to generate certificates at all for the MTS environment -
simply use the files provided in the MTS integration resources pack.  Copy them
into your config directory and rename as follows:

  mts_mutualssl_saml_sp.pem => sp-sign-key.pem
  mts_mutualssl_saml_sp.cer => sp-sign-crt.pem
  mts_saml_sp.pem           => sp-ssl-key.pem
  mts_saml_sp.cer           => sp-ssl-crt.pem

=item ITE (Staging)

For the ITE environment you can generate self-signed certs.  The C<nzigovt>
tool can prompt you interactively for the required parameters:

  nzigovt --conf-dir /etc/nzigovt make-certs

or you can provide them on the command-line:

  nzigovt --conf-dir /etc/nzigovt make-certs --env ITE \
    --org="Department of Innovation" --domain="innovation.govt.nz"

=item PROD (Production)

For the production environment you can use the C<nzigovt> tool to generate
Certificate Signing Requests which you will then submit to a Certification
Authority who will issue signed certificate files.  Save them in the config
directory using the filenames listed above.

  nzigovt --conf-dir /etc/nzigovt make-certs --env PROD ...

=back

=head3 SP Metadata

After you have generated the certificates, you can generate a metadata file
with the command:

  nzigovt --conf-dir /etc/nzigovt make-meta

You will be prompted to provide the necessary details and can re-run the
command to revise your answers.

Note: You can't simply edit the XML metadata file, because a digital signature
is added when the file is saved.

You will need to provide the SP metadata file to the igovt logon service (via
an upload to the shared workspace).  For ITE and PROD you will also need to
provide the certificate files.  You can assemble a 'bundle' of the required
files with this command:

  nzigovt --conf-dir /etc/nzigovt make-bundle


=head1 TESTING

Normally your application would generate an authentication request URL and
redirect the client to it, however it is also possible to generate one from the
command-line:

  nzigovt --conf-dir /etc/nzigovt make-req

You can paste this URL into a browser and complete a log on.  Once you have
logged on you will be redirected back to the URL for the ACS (as specified in
the SP metadata file that you uploaded).  You can copy the ACS URL from your
browser and paste it into the following command to resolve the artifact passed
in the URL to an FLT:

  nzigovt --conf-dir /etc/nzigovt resolve <ACS URL> <Request ID>

The ACS URL will contain special characters that may need to be quoted.  You'll
also need to supply the Request ID which was output by the original C<make-req>
command.


=head1 API REFERENCE

The C<Authen::NZigovt> class provides entry points for interactions with the
igovt logon service and is also responsible for dispatching the various
command implemented by the C<nzigovt> command-line utility.

=head2 service_provider( conf_dir => $path_to_config_directory )

This method is the main entry point for the API.  It returns a service_provider
object that will then be used to generate AuthnRequest messages and to resolve
the returned artifacts.  Unless you have set up alternative class mappings (see
below), this method is a simple wrapper for the
L<Authen::NZigovt::ServiceProvider> constructor.

=head2 class_for( identifier )

This method forms half of a simple dependency injection framework.  Rather
than hard-code the classnames for the various parts of the API, this method
is used to turn a simple functional name (e.g.: C<'service_provider'>) into a
classname like C<Authen::NZigovt::ServiceProvider>.  This method will also
load the loads the package using C<require>.

You would not usually call this method directly - instead you would use the
C<service_provider> method which calls this.

=head2 register_class( identifier => package )

This method forms the other half of the dependency injection implementation
and is used to override the default mappings.  The most common reason to use
this method is to inject mock object classnames for use during automated
testing.

=head2 run_command( command, args )

This method is called by the C<nzigovt> command-line tool, to delegate tasks to
the appropriate classes.  For more information about available commands, see
C<< nzigovt --help >>

=cut

=head2 Related Classes

Your application should only need to directly interface with the Service
Provider module (as shown above).  The service provider will delegate to other
classes as required.  Reference documentation is available for these other
classes.

=head1 BUGS

The current implementation does not attempt any validation of the SSL cert
presented by the IdP when connecting over the backchannel to resolve an
artifact.  However, the resulting assertion I<is> checked to confirm that a) it
is a response to the specified request_id I<and> b) the response has a valid
digital signature (using the IdP public key from the metadata file).

There is no implementation of SingleLogOut functionality.

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
